Ok, so solo mining, you need to use coal xxx where xxx are the command

If you want to check your balance use
```coal balance```
To claim
```coal claim```

As you are solo mining you are paying for your transaction fees, I suggest you to join a pool to avoid that, especially if you don't have an high amount of hash power
